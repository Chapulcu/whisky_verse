# Implementation Plan: Kullanıcı Tercihlerine Göre Viski Öneri Sistemi

**Branch**: `001-kullan-c-tercihlerine` | **Date**: 2025-09-26 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-kullan-c-tercihlerine/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Implement a personalized whisky recommendation system that analyzes user preferences, ratings, and past interactions to provide tailored whisky suggestions. System will support user-defined budget filtering, daily recommendation updates, comprehensive performance tracking, and hybrid fallback for users with insufficient data. Technical approach leverages React/TypeScript frontend with Supabase backend for recommendation engine and analytics.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.6.2, React 18.3.1
**Primary Dependencies**: Supabase 2.55.0, Framer Motion 12.23.12, React Router DOM 6.28.0, i18next 25.3.6
**Storage**: Supabase PostgreSQL with RLS policies, Real-time subscriptions
**Testing**: React Testing Library, integration tests, contract tests
**Target Platform**: Web (Chrome 90+, Safari 14+, Firefox 88+, mobile responsive)
**Project Type**: Web application (React SPA with Supabase backend)
**Performance Goals**: <200ms response time for recommendations, <1s page load, 60fps animations
**Constraints**: <200ms p95 latency, WCAG accessibility compliance, Turkish/English i18n
**Scale/Scope**: 10k+ users, recommendation engine, analytics dashboard, preference management

**Structure Decision**: Web application structure selected based on existing React/TypeScript architecture. Recommendation feature integrates into existing `src/components`, `src/pages`, `src/hooks`, `src/services`, and `src/types` directories. Follows constitutional component-driven architecture with proper separation of concerns.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- API contract → contract test tasks [P] for recommendations, preferences, analytics APIs
- Data entities → TypeScript model creation tasks [P] for each entity
- React components → component creation tasks for RecommendationCard, PreferenceFilter
- Services → service implementation tasks for recommendation algorithms, analytics
- Integration scenarios → integration test tasks based on quickstart scenarios

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Contract tests → Unit tests → Integration tests → Implementation
- Dependency order: Types → Models → Services → Components → Pages
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files that don't share dependencies)
- Recommendation algorithm implementation after data models
- UI components after service layer completion

**Specific Task Categories**:
1. **Setup & Infrastructure** (3-4 tasks): Database schema, TypeScript types, project structure
2. **Testing Foundation** (8-10 tasks): Contract tests for all APIs, component tests, integration test setup
3. **Core Implementation** (12-15 tasks): Data models, recommendation service, analytics service, React components
4. **Integration & Polish** (6-8 tasks): Page integration, mobile responsiveness, i18n, performance optimization

**Estimated Output**: 30-35 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md following constitutional TDD requirements

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)

- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete

**Gate Status**:
