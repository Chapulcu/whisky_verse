# Research: Whisky Recommendation System

**Feature**: Kullanıcı Tercihlerine Göre Viski Öneri Sistemi
**Date**: 2025-09-26
**Phase**: 0 (Research & Analysis)

## Recommendation Algorithm Approaches

### Decision: Content-Based Filtering with Collaborative Filtering Hybrid
**Rationale**:
- Content-based filtering works well for new users using whisky characteristics (age, region, flavor profile)
- Collaborative filtering leverages user similarity for experienced users with rating history
- Hybrid approach addresses cold start problem and improves accuracy over time

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Pure collaborative filtering: Rejected due to cold start issues for new users
- Pure content-based: Rejected due to limited personalization for experienced users
- Matrix factorization: Too complex for initial implementation, consider for v2

### Decision: Similarity Calculation using Cosine Similarity
**Rationale**:
- Well-suited for sparse user-item interaction matrices
- Computationally efficient for real-time recommendations
- Handles varying user activity levels effectively

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Euclidean distance: Less effective with sparse data
- Pearson correlation: Better for dense datasets, overkill for initial scope

## Data Storage and Performance

### Decision: Supabase PostgreSQL with Materialized Views for Performance
**Rationale**:
- Leverages existing WhiskyVerse infrastructure
- RLS policies ensure data security
- Materialized views for pre-computed similarity scores
- Real-time subscriptions for recommendation updates

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Dedicated recommendation engine (Redis): Additional infrastructure complexity
- In-memory caching only: Data persistence concerns
- External ML service: Cost and complexity for MVP

### Decision: Daily Batch Processing for Recommendation Updates
**Rationale**:
- Aligns with clarified requirement for nightly updates
- Reduces computational load during peak usage
- Allows for comprehensive similarity recalculation

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Real-time updates: Higher computational cost, unnecessary for daily refresh requirement
- Weekly updates: Too infrequent for dynamic user preferences

## Performance Metrics and Analytics

### Decision: Comprehensive Multi-Metric Tracking System
**Rationale**:
- Aligns with clarified requirement for combined metrics
- Enables A/B testing and recommendation algorithm improvements
- Provides business intelligence for platform optimization

**Metrics Implementation**:
- **Engagement**: Click-through rate, time spent viewing recommendations, scroll depth
- **Feedback**: Like/dislike ratio, "already tried" frequency, rating patterns
- **Conversion**: Add to favorites rate, purchase link clicks, collection additions

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Single metric focus: Insufficient for comprehensive evaluation
- Third-party analytics only: Limited customization for recommendation-specific metrics

## External Integration Strategy

### Decision: Multi-Source Purchase Link Aggregation
**Rationale**:
- Meets requirement for both local and international sources
- Increases user value through price comparison
- Provides revenue opportunities through affiliate partnerships

**Implementation Approach**:
- Local sources: Migros, CarrefourSA, alkol.com.tr
- International: Amazon, Master of Malt, The Whisky Exchange
- API-first approach with fallback to web scraping for price data

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Single source integration: Limited user value
- Manual curation only: Scalability issues

## Hybrid Fallback Strategy

### Decision: Popularity-Based with Profile Expansion
**Rationale**:
- Addresses insufficient personalization data scenarios
- Maintains user engagement for new users
- Gradual transition to personalized recommendations

**Implementation Logic**:
1. Check user interaction threshold (5+ ratings)
2. If below threshold: Show popular whiskies filtered by basic preferences
3. Expand criteria gradually (region → price → style)
4. Track engagement to transition to personalized recommendations

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Random recommendations: Poor user experience
- Static popular list: Ignores user preferences entirely

## Privacy and Security Considerations

### Decision: Anonymized Analytics with Secure Preference Storage
**Rationale**:
- Complies with constitutional security requirements
- Maintains recommendation accuracy while protecting privacy
- Enables aggregate analytics without personal data exposure

**Implementation**:
- Hash user IDs for analytics storage
- RLS policies for all recommendation data
- Opt-out mechanisms for tracking
- Clear data retention policies

## Technology Integration Points

### Decision: React Context + Custom Hooks Pattern
**Rationale**:
- Aligns with constitutional component-driven architecture
- Provides clean separation of recommendation logic
- Enables easy testing and maintainability

**Hook Structure**:
- `useRecommendations`: Core recommendation fetching and state management
- `useUserPreferences`: Preference management and filtering
- `useRecommendationFeedback`: Feedback collection and analytics

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Global state management (Redux): Overkill for recommendation feature scope
- Direct API calls in components: Violates architectural principles

## Performance Targets and Constraints

### Decision: <200ms Response Time with Progressive Enhancement
**Rationale**:
- Meets constitutional performance requirements
- Provides excellent user experience
- Allows for complex algorithms while maintaining responsiveness

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Pre-computed recommendations stored in database
- Lazy loading for detailed whisky information
- Progressive enhancement for advanced filtering
- CDN caching for static recommendation data

## Internationalization Strategy

### Decision: i18next Integration with Dynamic Content Translation
**Rationale**:
- Leverages existing WhiskyVerse i18n infrastructure
- Supports Turkish/English recommendation content
- Enables future language expansion

**Implementation**:
- Translate recommendation reasons and explanations
- Support localized price formatting and currency
- Cultural preference weighting (Turkish vs. international whisky preferences)
